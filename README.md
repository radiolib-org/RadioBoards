## Crowd-sourced database of radio module pinouts

RadioBoards is a crowd-sourced database of pinouts for various sub-GHz radio modules. Some examples include:
* Heltec WiFi LoRa boards
* LilyGo TTGO LoRa32/TBeam boards
* Seedstudio WM1110
* ... and many others!

This database has the form of a light-weight C++ library, so it can be readily used by C++ projects.
Modules in `src/maintained` are maintained by the members of the [RadioLib Org](https://github.com/radiolib-org), while modules in `src/contributed` have been contributed by members of the wonderful RadioLib community!

## Getting started

The fastest way to get started is to take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/radiolib-org/RadioBoards/tree/main/examples).

## Contributing

If you have a tested, verified radio module pinout that you would like to share, feel free to open up an [Issue](https://github.com/radiolib-org/RadioBoards/issues) or, even better, a [Pull Request](https://github.com/radiolib-org/RadioBoards/pulls)!
